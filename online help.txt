Works Cited Page.

I hereby certify that this is indeed, my own work.  I have used many resources such as github, live events, help on forums from fellow classmates and these websites belew for research and development for this project.

http://www.frontendwebhelp.com/ 
for general .js questions and just researching how to properly optimize a website and js.

ngrog.com / i did not end up using ngrog to test my page load speeds, i could never fully get it to function properly.

google had very useful tips and information..

https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/module/filters

it did not apply to a lot of this particular project, but was very informative.

using inline css could possibly help this project , if i took it even further and had more time.

there may have been a few more websites i used for inspiration, but did not write all of them down as i was just browsing for information as my questions popped up with this project.

Thanks again for the experience.
